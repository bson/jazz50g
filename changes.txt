NOTES:

	Even though Jazz does not currently support the long float
	objects ( DOLNGREAL and DOLNGCMP ), it is possible to compile
	such objects as follows:

	ASSEMBLE
			CON(5)	=DOLNGREAL
			REL(5)	->endmant
			NIBHEX	123456789
	->endmant	REL(5)	->endexp
			NIBHEX	123456
	->endexp
	RPL


	ASSEMBLE
			CON(5)	=DOLNGCMP
			REL(5)	->endmantR
			NIBHEX	123456789
	->endmantR	REL(5)	->endexpR
			NIBHEX	123456
	->endexpR	REL(5)	->endmantI
			NIBHEX	123456789
	->endmantI	REL(5)	->endexpI
			NIBHEX	123456
	->endexpI
	RPL

	These object types are actually not even well-defined. It
	appears that the sign nibble for these objects is either 0
	for positive mantissa/exponent and non-zero for negatives.
	However, it is unclear whether the negative should be the
	digit #9h or #Fh.

CHANGELOG:

v2010.0.06
   o	Jazz no longer requires HPTAB; uses extable instead. This
	version of extable is back-ward compatible; only the version
	provided with the Jazz package will work with Jazz! (DO NOT
	use older extable libraries!)

   o	New token ROMPTR2; usage is the same as with Debug4x

   o	Reverted SDB to emulate buggy ROM for CK&DISPATCH1 and related
	commands; fixed bug with integer-to-real conversion

   o	gentab2.c updated to create source file of entries table for
	extable library and now included

   o	EC search string allows up to 24 chars (length of the longest
	known entry); also fixed an bug related to ECpgdn as well as
	swaping out of lexico mode

   o	EC has a new option to toggle entry type ( F3 key ) so that
	longer names can be fully viewed

   o	EC can now properly view ^<entry> and ~<entry> however EC will
	not follow flash pointers correctly beyond the initial
	disassembly. This will be adjusted in the next release. EC
	also does not properly identify these entries (harmless but
	will also be fixed next release).

   o	Fixed some errors in the Jazz manual.

v2010.06.26
   o	Minor updates to how labels are generated when the word
	is a flash pointer

   o	SDB handling of CK&DISPATCH1 (and hence, related entries)
	updated to emulate ROM; also includes two bug fixes that
	are currently in ROM 2.15

v2010.06.16
   o	ASS now assembles all new opcodes (except NATIVE? hh -- I
	have no idea what this opcode would actually be used for,
	so it is currently not implemented)

   o	ASS also now compiles FPTR2 and ZINT; no support for long
	floats or long complex numbers -- is anyone even interested
	in this? It is still possible to compile these objects via
	ASSEMBLE ... RPL environments within Jazz. If enough people
	want this, I'll code it in.

   o	A bug fix in SafeSkipOb's dispatch table for new ob types

   o	ED now handles FPTR2 names when viewed with DoEd_DOB

   o	SSTK now implemented -- this version merely maintains flags
	-79 and -85, restoring them upon exiting SSTK. Coding SSTK
	to be more like the HP48 version is very cumbersome since
	GetKeyOb no longer returns a pointer to the key objects,
	and entries like CMD_DROP update the stack display directly
	(rather than setting the appropriate flag for outer loop
	display routine to handle). SSTK's error handler restores
	the old HP48 error message display rather than using the
	retarded (my personal opinion) icon message box that covers
	a good portion of the stack.

   o	SDB is now available in this version. To maintain user's
	stack display flags, a new kill command (xSKILL) is also
	now part of Jazz. Since some SysRPL entries are now both
	non-PCO and non-PRLG'd, the dispatch tables may need to
	include both the stable entry, and the address to which it
	points.

   o	FPTRs can only be single-stepped in SDB; no into mode (yet).

   o	Code-wise, SDB can now be compiled without Jazz for those
	who need a standalone SysRPL debugger.

   o	SSTK and SDB both use extable rather than library 993 by
	default. This was so that SDB could be compiled separately
	from Jazz.

   o	The entries library (hptab50.hp) may be stored in any port
	without loss of speed or requiring RAM to copy to main
	memory. Jazz now configures the library on the fly.

v2010.05.24
   o	Ported from HP48 code version 6.8a, which includes some bug
	fixes (perhaps backport some bug-fixes to HP48 code later)

   o	FindObEnd no longer assumes PCOs end at next PCO or RPL.
	PCO objects and ML code are treated alike due to changes in
	ROM. The end of a PCO or ML entry is computed as either the
	start of a PCO, a common RPL object, or as detected by the
	FINDMLEND routine -- whichever comes first.

   o	No longer requires UFL; MINIFONT used instead

   o	Includes MINIFONT editor

   o	DIS can disassemble new objects:
		DOINT		ZINT dddd...
		DOFLASHP	FPTR hhh hhhh
		DOMINIFONT	MINIFONT hhhhh hhhhh...
		DOMATRIX	MATRIX ... ;
		DOLNGREAL	L% sddd...Eseee...
		DOLNGCMP	LC% sddd...Esee... sddd...Esee...
				    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
				    real part	 complex part

   o	DIS can disassemble newer opcodes (BUSCC hh) and includes new 
	field selectrs Fn (see newopcodes.txt); all known new opcodes
	are included

   o	DIS also handles special opcodes for common routines in ROM
	(Some are still missing -- just the ones that replace certain
	repetitive routines; for example ARM_LOOP is a new name I use
	for the opcode replacing =Loop)

	Unofficial dissasembly includes:

	TOKEN		OPCODE	ROM 	OVERWRITTEN
	--------	------	------	----------------
	ARM_LOOP		=Loop
			81B|1	142	A=DAT0
				164	D0=D0+	5
					...

	ARM_SEMI		=SEMI
				03130	CON(5)	(*)+5
			81B|D	D9	C=B	A
				136	CD0EX
					...

	ARM_G1RC	81B|E	G1RC	(unsupported)
				427	GOC	#02E15
				D9	C=B	A
					...


	>KEYTIM			n/a

	These tokens are for disassembly purposes only; they WILL
	NOT compile. Others were not given any special disassembly
	output.

   o	ED, VV both support 131x80 screens; in fact, it assumes
	BigApple platform 

   o	ED has remapped keys to better match the keyboard of the
	HP50G (see source for layout info; see also ed_layout.txt)

   o	ED disassembly mode can now be used to disassemble any object
	in any flash bank, and even keeps track of the rom view
	history

   o	Initial support for assembling matrices, minifont, and flash
	pointers (FPTR xxx yyyy)

   o	EC has additional keys MODE/STO/APPS/TOOL

   o	EC/ED/DOB recognizes #11111 entries

   o	EC/ED/DOB now correctly disassembles indirections via #11111

   o	EC/ED/DOB also recognizes non-PCO SysRPL entries (all the
	named entries between !REDIMUSER and $5x7)

   o	DBHOOK now sets up all necessary hooks and DBpar

   o	DB now uses entries table regardless of entry mode; all
	screens have been slightly modified for either more data
	display or rearranged for better data organization

   o	DB handles all new opcodes, including ?HS=1 n and even the
	undocumented opcodes. However, care should be taken when
	debugging new BUSCC opcodes as some can circumvent the code
	trapping set up by DB (in particular those which alter the
	interrupt flags)
